# VRsicknessProj

Unity / C# Project designed for an academic analysis on the effect of shaders on VR sickness.

Candidates to this experiment were asked to go through this interactive VR experience (It's roller coaster:D), and then asked a set of questions.

The experiment was then repeated after applying different sets of shaders to the simulation, in order to test their impact on VR sickness symptoms.
